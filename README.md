# Algorithm Visualizer 


A web app for visualizing different algorithms ranging from sorting,searching to graph.Also has a code editor for the user to practice algorithms<br/>
#### Check the project [here](https://algo-visualizer242.herokuapp.com/)<br/>
Tech Stack used:
- Html
- Css
- Jquery
- Express

## Steps to start the app(if you want to fork it and run on your local machine)
1.Should have Nodejs installed
2.Go to the root of the directory and in the terminal write npm start or nodemon server(if you have nodemon)

## Algorithms visualized:
Sorting:
- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Selection sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Heap sort

Searching:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Ternary Search

Graph:
- Breadth First Search(BFS)
- Dijkstra Algorithm

## Note
For anyone who wants to go through the code for every visualizer main.js will act as the main file for dom manipulation and calling helper functions like bfs,bubble sort etc
Every algorithm used has been named as a seperate file
